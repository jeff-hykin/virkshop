# beta
- todo: clean up `virkshop/mixin` so that it doesn't depend on a command line git (maybe also try avoiding the use of allow-unrelated-histories)
    - maybe make it use the same @append system for all its files/folders, and then avoid git entirely
    - maybe look into git merging, but treating all the mixin stuff as ealier-commits (compared to on-this-repo commits)
- allow specifing binary names from particular packages
- create an ENV-diff command for "it works on my machine" scenarios

- add a check to make sure the virkshop folder doesnt contain non-necessary items
- squash all the commits
- handle env vars from computed values

# delta
- use WASM git inside of deno
- tutorializer
- nix-based if statements
- generic nix variables
- only load executable names that are directly mentioned (no extra/overflow binaries in path)

old todo:
- create `virkshop.appendToEnvVar`
    - will need a way to save/seralize data
        - add a hidden getter that maps to a json file inside of short term temp
    - create `setEnvVar()`
        - add a process as the very first .zsh script, have it be dynamically generated by a deno script
            - handle defining env vars
    - create `appendToEnvVar()`
    - create `prependToEnvVar()`
    - make those functions give an error if they're executed inside the Virkshop itself (or come up with a complex system of writing to another file and having zsh source that file after every execution)
- inline all the startup scripts
    - generate a single .zshrc file
    - for each .zsh file, inline it
    - for all other files, just try running them
- do custom work for the home mixin
    - notify user about potential conflicts
    - notify mixins if they attempt to use something like `.bashrc`
- create `addToGitignore()` function
- mixin tools
    - redo the startup message
    - have nix_tools use deno to link to the nix profile real-home, then 
    - fix git hooks
- figure out how to combine the nix file from individual mixins
- `triggerEvent()` function
- `wrapExecutable()` function for sudo, vim, and the like
- `appendToEnvVar()`
- `zshrc()`
- standardize and publish a deno FileSystem lib
- standardize and publish a deno Virkshop lib
- consider having a background deno task for faster execution times of scripts
- consider verifying the structure (broken links) as a background task after the shell starts
- make the nix install check faster
- make enter rewrite itself (and ignore changes) after a user successfully runs it once. Have the rewrite change the hashbang
