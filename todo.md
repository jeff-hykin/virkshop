# pre-alpha:
- try getting super_map to work with virkshop
- create branches like `pure` `standard`

- scan and clear out dead links
- reconsider what can be modular and what cant
    - consider making system_tools be @project/system_tools, and concating all the files
        => kind of a problem with variable namespacing
        consider the user experiance with the worst namespacing problem
    - consider making the mix command more advanced. "mix" could be when:
        - mixins copy their default settings into @project
        - add things to system_tools
        - mixins initialize git ignores
        - mixins initialize hooks
        - HOWEVER this removes the "delete the folder and its uninstalled" feature
            - but this^ cant really work for gitignores (except maybe through: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7005142/can-i-include-other-gitignore-file-in-a-gitignore-file-like-include-in-c-li)
- add !load_yaml_file or !insert
- DONE: remove relative paths to virkshop.js, use URL instead, maybe have a walk-up importer from URL and everything else local
- DONE: create method for removing relative paths to virkshop.js
- DONE: cli "virkshop/install [package name]"
- DONE: add `!!deno`
- DONE: create deno library for virkshop
- DONE: create virkshop trigger for purge/clean
- DONE: create clean command
- DONE: create purge command
- DONE: consider allowing env vars to be set inside system_tools
    - prepend
    - append

- DONE: pad out numbers and auto-rename them
- DONE: allow loading advanced nix code
- DONE: make nix_tools, os_mac, etc unnecessary. Put everything inside @virkshop
- DONE: prevent mixins adding zshrc, zlogin, etc by anything other than the masterMixin
- DONE: clear out the dead code
- DONE: have .zshrc source a generated file
- DONE: stop bash from loading a profile (--norc --noprofile)
- DONE: get home folder linking working

# beta
- allow specifing binary names from particular packages
- Documentation
    - Basics
        - When is virkshop NOT a good idea?
        - How do I use someone's virkshop?
        - How do I make my own virkshop?
        - How can I customize a virkshop?
            1. Adding a command
                - always edit the `mixins/`
                - always debug the `mixture/`
            2. Adding a system tool
            3. Adding an env var
            4. 
            5. Adding a mixin
    - Advanced
        - How to add a custom nix expression
        - Making your own mixin
- add back TLDR cache linking
- make linking nix cache controllable through options.json
- virkshop update (wrapper around git mixin)
- git hook events
- make sure master mixin runs last for commands/documentation etc
- get auto-add to git ignore to work
- add basic documentation
- make a way to change shells (implement a javascript API for Zsh shell)
- mention when there are home-folder conflicts between mixins
- add a check to make sure the virkshop folder doesnt contain non-necessary items
- squash all the commits
- handle env vars from computed values

# delta
- tutorializer
- nix-based if statements
- generic nix variables
- only load executable names that are directly mentioned (no extra/overflow binaries in path)

old todo:
- create `virkshop.appendToEnvVar`
    - will need a way to save/seralize data
        - add a hidden getter that maps to a json file inside of short term temp
    - create `setEnvVar()`
        - add a process as the very first .zsh script, have it be dynamically generated by a deno script
            - handle defining env vars
    - create `appendToEnvVar()`
    - create `prependToEnvVar()`
    - make those functions give an error if they're executed inside the Virkshop itself (or come up with a complex system of writing to another file and having zsh source that file after every execution)
- inline all the startup scripts
    - generate a single .zshrc file
    - for each .zsh file, inline it
    - for all other files, just try running them
- do custom work for the home mixin
    - notify user about potential conflicts
    - notify mixins if they attempt to use something like `.bashrc`
- create `addToGitignore()` function
- mixin tools
    - redo the startup message
    - have nix_tools use deno to link to the nix profile real-home, then 
    - fix git hooks
- figure out how to combine the nix file from individual mixins
- `triggerEvent()` function
- `wrapExecutable()` function for sudo, vim, and the like
- `appendToEnvVar()`
- `zshrc()`
- standardize and publish a deno FileSystem lib
- standardize and publish a deno Virkshop lib
- consider having a background deno task for faster execution times of scripts
- consider verifying the structure (broken links) as a background task after the shell starts
- make the nix install check faster
- make enter rewrite itself (and ignore changes) after a user successfully runs it once. Have the rewrite change the hashbang
