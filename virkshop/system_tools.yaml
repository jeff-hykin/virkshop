# # example2: same outcome as example1, but using javascript (deno)
# #           this approach is about 1000ms faster than the cli-approach above because

    # !!deno                    # a string that will be evaluated in a deno runtime and replaced with the output
    # !!as_absolute_path        # useful for PATH, PYTHONPATH, and the like: converts a path (relative to this file) into a string that is an absolute-path
    # !!nix                     # system_tools.yaml is converted to a shell.nix file, this tag indicates that a string to be transfered directly/literally to that file
